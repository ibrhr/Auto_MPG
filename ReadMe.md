# Car Mileage Predictor

This project is a web application for predicting the mileage (MPG) of a car based on various input features. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on the Auto MPG dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Features

- Predicts car mileage based on input features such as Cylinders, Displacement, Horsepower, Weight, Acceleration, Model Year, and Origin.

- Web interface built with Flask.

- Preprocessing pipeline using scikit-learn for data transformation and feature engineering.

- Machine learning model (RandomForestRegressor) for prediction.
